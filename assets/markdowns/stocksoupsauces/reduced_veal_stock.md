### **Method Of Work**
1. Brown the bones and calves’ feet in a roasting
tray in the oven.
2. Place the browned bones in a stock pot, cover
with cold water and bring to simmering point.
3. Using the same roasting tray and the fat from the
bones, brown off the carrots, onions and celery.
4. Drain off the fat, add the vegetables to the stock
and deglaze the tray.
5. Add the remainder of the ingredients; simmer
gently for 4–5 hours. Skim frequently.
6. Strain the stock into a clean pan and reduce until
a light consistency is achieved.

>No flour is used in the thickening process and consequently a lighter textured sauce is produced. 

>Care needs to be taken when reducing this type of sauce, however, so that the end product is not too strong or bitter.
