### **Method Of Work**
1. Chop the beef bones and brown well on all sides
either by placing in a roasting tin in the oven or
carefully browning in a little fat in a frying pan.
2. Drain off any fat and place the bones in a stock
pot.
3. Brown any sediment that may be in the bottom
of the tray, deglaze (swill out) with half a litre of
boiling water, simmer for a few minutes and add
to the bones.
4. Add the cold water, bring to the boil and skim.
Simmer for 2 hours.
5. Wash, peel and roughly cut the vegetables, fry in
a little fat until brown, strain and add to the bones.
6. Add the bouquet garni and peppercorns.
7. Simmer for 6â€“8 hours. Skim and strain.
