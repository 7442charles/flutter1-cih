### **Method Of Work**
1. Place the beef, free from fat, in a saucepan and
cover with cold water.
2. Bring to the boil, then immediately wash off under
running water.
3. Clean the pan, replace the meat, cover with cold
stock, bring to the boil and skim.
4. Add the washed barley, simmer for 1 hour.
5. Add the vegetables, bouquet garni and
seasoning.
6. Skim when necessary; simmer for approximately
30 minutes, until tender.
7. Remove the meat, allow to cool and cut from the
bone, remove all fat and cut the meat into neat
dice the same size as the vegetables; return to
the broth.
8. Correct the seasoning, skim off all the fat, add the
chopped parsley and serve.

### ***Healthy eating tips***
- Remove all fat from the meat.
- use only a small amount of salt.
- There are lots of healthy vegetables in this dish and the addition of a large bread roll will increase the starchy carbohydrate.
