### **Ingredients (3L)**
- 5kg Chicken carcass
- 1.5 Onion
- 2 Carrot
- 2 Cloves of garlic
- 1 Leek
- 2 Celery Stick
- 1 Spring of Thyme
- 5g White peppercorns
- 5L water

### **Method of work**
1. Remove any excess fat from the chicken
carcasses and wash off under cold water.
2. Place all the bones into a pot that will hold all the
ingredients, leaving 5 cm at the top to skim.
3. Add all the other ingredients and cold water, and
bring to a simmer; immediately skim all the fat that
rises to the surface.
4. Turn the heat off and allow the bones and
vegetables to sink. Once this has happened, turn
the heat back on, skim and bring to just under a
simmer, making as little movement as possible
to create more of an infusion than a stock. Skim
continuously.
5. Leave to simmer (infuse) for 12 hours then pass
through a fine sieve into a clean pan; reduce
down rapidly until you have about 3 litres
remaining.
