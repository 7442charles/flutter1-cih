| Ingredients            | Quantity               |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Butter or Oil          | 100g                   |
| Flour                  | 100g                   |
| Milk, warmed           | 1L                     |
| Onion                  | 1, studded with cloves |


### **Method Of work**
1. Melt the butter or heat the oil in a thick-bottomed
pan.
2.  Mix in the flour with a heat-proof plastic or
wooden spoon.
3. Cook for a few minutes, stirring frequently. As you
are making a white roux, do not allow the mixture
to colour.
4. Remove the pan from the heat to allow the roux to
cool.
5. Return the pan to the stove and, over a low heat,
gradually mix the milk into the roux.
6. Add the studded onion.
7. Allow the mixture to simmer gently for 30 minutes,
stirring frequently to make sure the sauce does
not burn on the bottom.
8. Remove the onion and pass the sauce through a
conical strainer.

**Variation**

*For cream sauce, finish with 125 ml single cream per litre
of bÃ©chamel sauce.*

> **chefs tip**
> To prevent a skin from forming, brush the surface with melted butter. 
>When ready to use, stir this into the sauce. Alternatively, cover the sauce with cling film or greaseproof paper.
