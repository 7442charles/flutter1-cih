### **Method of Work**
1. Blanch the peas in a small pan of boiling water for
3 minutes, then drain.
2. Heat the oil in a large saucepan and cook the
shallots without letting them colour.
3. Add the peas to this pan, and cook for a further
2–3 minutes, again without colouring.
4. Add the milk, bring to a simmer and cook until the
peas are tender.
5. Cool the mixture slightly, then transfer to a food
processor and liquidise until very smooth – this
may take a while. At this point, the soup can
be cooled completely and stored in an airtight
container in the refrigerator until ready to serve.
6. Add the cream and butter just before serving.
