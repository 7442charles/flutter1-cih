# White Stock



White stock is a flavorful base used in many soups, sauces, and dishes. It is commonly made from bones and aromatics. Here's a recipe for preparing white stock:

## Ingredients

- 2 pounds of chicken bones or beef bones
- 1 onion, quartered
- 2 carrots, chopped
- 2 celery stalks, chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 teaspoon of whole peppercorns
- Salt, to taste
- Water, enough to cover the ingredients

## Method of Work

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. Place the bones on a baking sheet and roast them in the oven for about 30 minutes until they turn golden brown. This step enhances the flavor of the stock.
3. In a large pot, add the roasted bones, onion, carrots, celery, garlic, bay leaf, and peppercorns.
4. Pour enough water into the pot to cover all the ingredients.
5. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for at least 3-4 hours. Skim any impurities or foam that rise to the surface.
6. After simmering, strain the stock through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth into another pot or container. Discard the solids.
7. Allow the stock to cool, then refrigerate it overnight. This will help the fat to solidify on the surface, making it easier to remove.
8. Skim off the fat from the top of the stock and discard it.
9. The white stock is now ready to be used in your favorite recipes.

Enjoy the rich and flavorful white stock in your culinary creations!
