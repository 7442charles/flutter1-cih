## Sugar Cooking
**Basic principle**
A solution or syrup of sugar and water is boiled to evaporate part of the water.   
After the water have evarporated you are left with melted sugar.  
The sugar then caramelize (turns brown and changes flavor).

**Simple Syrup**
This is a solution of equal weights of sugar and water. 
Combine equal weight of water and granulated sufar in a saucepan, stir and bring to a boil to dissolve the sugar.

**Dessert syrup** 
A flavored simple syrup used to moisten and flovour some cakes.
Flavor should be added after the syrup has cooled because most flavors may be lost of that are added to hot syrup.

**Crystallization**
This is the formation of grains in many candies and desserts. They form when cooked sugar crystallizes.
