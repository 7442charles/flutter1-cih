|Caster Sugar|100g|
|Water|80ml|
|Double cream |500ml|
|Egg Yolks, Lightly beaten(optional)|2|


**Method of work**
1. In a large saucepan, dissolve the sugar with the water over a low heating and bring to boiling point.
2. Wash down the inside of the pan with a pastry brush dipped in cold water to prevent crystals from forming.
3. Cook until the sugar turns to a deep amber colour. Immediately turn off the heat and whisk in the cream.
4. Set the pan back over a high heat and stir the sauce with the whisk. Let it bubble for 2 minutes, then turn off the heat.
5. You can now strain the sauce and use it when cooled, or, for a richer, smoother sauce, pour a little caramel on to the egg yolks, then return the mixture to the pan and heat to 80 Â°C, taking care that it does not boil.
6. Pass the sauce through a conical strainer and keep in a cool place, stirring occasionally to prevent a skin from forming.
