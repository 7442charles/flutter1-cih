**Method of work**
1. Mix the egg yolks and sugar together and slowly add the boiled fruit purée which has been flavoured with a squeeze of lemon juice.
2. Return to the stove and cook to 80 °C until slightly thickened. Do not boil.
3. Add the previously softened gelatine to the warm purée and mix until fully dissolved. Chill down.
4. Prepare the Italian meringue by placing the sugar in a pan and saturating in water.
5. Boil the sugar to 115 °C, then whisk the egg whites with a pinch of cream of tartar.
6. Once the egg whites are at full peak, gradually add the boiled sugar which now should have reached the temperature of 121 °C. Whisk until cold.
7. Once the purée is cold, but not set, incorporate the Italian meringue and whipped cream.
8. Place into piping bag and pipe into the desired ring mould, normally lined with a suitable sponge such as a jaconde.
9. Level the surface using a palette knife and refrigerate.
10. Once set, glace the surface, refrigerate.
11. To remove from the mould, warm the outside of the mould with a blow torch and remove the ring mould.

**Glaze**
1. Warm the syrup. Add the gelatine and stir until dissolved, then add the desired fruit purée.
2. Apply to the surface of the chilled mousse whilst in a liquid state, but not hot.
