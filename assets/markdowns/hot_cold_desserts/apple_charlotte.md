**Method of work**
1. Peel, core and cut the apples into thick slices.
2. Melt the butter in a pan, add the sugar and finely grated lemon zest.
3. Add the apples and simmer until barely cooked, stir in some breadcrumbs to absorb any liquid.
4. Cut out circles of bread for the top and base of the moulds.
5. Cut the crusts and the rest of the bread into fingers 2–3 cm wide, depending on whether you are making individual or larger charlottes.
6. Butter the moulds, dip half the circles in the clarified butter and place them butter-side down in the base of each mould.
7. Next, dip the bread fingers and line them around the outside of the moulds, slightly overlapping.
8. Fill the centre with the apple filling, pressing in carefully.
9. Dip the rest of the circles in the butter and place on top, pressing firmly.
10. Bake at 230 °C for 30–40 minutes until the bread is coloured and crisp.
11. Allow to cool slightly before unmoulding; serve with hot apricot sauce or crème anglaise.
