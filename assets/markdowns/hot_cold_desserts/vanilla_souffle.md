|Ingredients|Quantity|
|-----------|--------|
|**Base Mixture**||
|Milk|500ml|
|Vanilla Pods|2|
|Butter|75g|
|Strong flour|60g|
|Egg Yolks|10|
|Caster sugar|50g|
|**Addtional ingredients for every 400g of base misture**||
|Egg whites|150g|
|Caster sugar|60g|
|Cornflour|12g|
|lemon Juice|2-3 drops|


**Method of work**
1. Rinse a heavy saucepan with cold water and add the milk. Split the vanilla pod, scrape out the seeds, and add both to the milk. Put on the heat to boil.
2. Melt the butter in another heavy pan. Add the flour and cook out to form a white roux. Gradually add the boiling milk, mixing in each addition before adding the next.
3. When all the milk has been added, allow to simmer for a few minutes.
4.  Whisk the egg yolks and sugar. Add to the mixture in the saucepan and keep stirring over the heat until the mixture starts to bubble around the edges. This forms the panada.
5.  Pour on to a clean tray and cover with cling film to prevent a skin forming. Allow to cool. (This can be kept in the fridge until needed, as soufflés must be cooked to order.)
6.  Take 400 g of the base and beat in a clean bowl until smooth.
7.  Whisk the egg whites, sugar, cornflour and lemon juice to form firm peaks.
8.  Add one-third of the whites to the base and mix in, then very carefully fold in the remaining whites.
9.  Carefully fill prepared individual china ramekins. Level the top and run your thumb around the edge, moving the mixture away from the lip of the mould.
10. Space well apart on a solid baking sheet (if they are close together they will not rise evenly and will bake stuck together).
11. Place immediately in the oven at 215 °C for 12–14 minutes.
12. The soufflés should rise out of the moulds by around 5–6 cm and have a flat top with no cracks.
13. Dust with icing sugar and serve immediately with fruit coulis and/or ice cream (chocolate or vanilla).
