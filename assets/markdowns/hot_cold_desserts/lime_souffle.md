**Method of work**
1. Use individual stainless steel ring moulds. Cut a strip of acetate, 8 cm wide, to fit inside each ring. Cut a 6 cm strip to fit inside the first, spread it with tempered couverture and place inside the first strip, in the mould.
2. Place a round of sponge in the base of each mould and moisten with lime syrup.
3. Make the Swiss meringue.
4. Whisk the cream until it is three-quarters whipped, then chill.
5. Whisk together the egg yolks, sugar and blanched lime zest. Boil the juice and pour it over the mixture to make the sabayon. Whisk over a bain-marie until it reaches 75 Â°C, then continue whisking away from the heat until it is cold.
6. Drain and melt the gelatine. Fold it into the sabayon.
7. Fold in the Swiss meringue, and then the chilled whipped cream.
8. Fill the prepared moulds. Level the tops and chill until set.
9. To serve, carefully remove the mould, peel away the acetate, plate and decorate.
