**Method of work**
1. Cream the butter and sugar until lighter in colour and an increase in volume of approximately 30 per cent is achieved.
2. Sieve the flour and baking powder twice to ensure even dispersion.
3.  Beat the eggs and gradually add to the butter and sugar, beating in each addition before adding the next.
4.  Finally, fold in the dry ingredients.
5.  Add enough milk to achieve a dropping
consistency.
6. Fill buttered dariole moulds three-quarters full.
7. Place a disc of silicone paper on top and cover with foil; create a pleat to allow for expansion and crimp the edges around the lip of the mould to seal.
8. Steam for 45â€“50 minutes.
