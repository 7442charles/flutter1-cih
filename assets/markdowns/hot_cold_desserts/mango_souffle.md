To make the mango compote:

2. Pour hot stock syrup over the mango dice and leave to cool.

To make the souffles:

1. Bring the milk and mango purée to the boil.
2. Make the liaison by whisking the egg yolks with the caster sugar. Sieve in the cornflour and continue whisking until smooth.
3. Add one-third of the boiling liquid to the liaison.
4. Bring the rest of the liquid back to the boil. Whisk the liaison into it, then continue whisking until it returns to the boil. Simmer for 2–3 minutes. Cover and cool.
5. Whisk the egg whites, lemon juice, sugar and cornflour together to the consistency of shaving foam. Fold this into the cooled mango pastry cream mixture.
6. Place a spoonful of mango compote into the bottom of each prepared soufflé mould. Pour in the soufflé mixture and level it off with a palette knife.
7. Bake at 200 °C for approximately 12 minutes.
8. Remove carefully from the oven, dredge with icing sugar and serve immediately.
