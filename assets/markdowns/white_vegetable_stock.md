# White Vegetable Stock

White vegetable stock is a flavorful and versatile base for various vegetarian dishes. Made with a combination of aromatic vegetables, herbs, and spices, it adds depth and complexity to soups, stews, risottos, and more. Here's how you can make white vegetable stock:

## Ingredients

- 2 onions, roughly chopped
- 2 carrots, roughly chopped
- 2 celery stalks, roughly chopped
- 2 leeks, washed and roughly chopped
- 1 fennel bulb, roughly chopped
- 3 cloves of garlic, crushed
- 1 bay leaf
- 4 sprigs of fresh thyme
- 6-8 parsley stems
- 10 whole peppercorns
- 8 cups of water

## Method

1. In a large stockpot, add the onions, carrots, celery, leeks, fennel, and garlic.
2. Place the bay leaf, thyme sprigs, parsley stems, and peppercorns in a piece of cheesecloth or a muslin bag, and tie it securely to create a bouquet garni.
3. Add the bouquet garni to the stockpot with the vegetables.
4. Pour in the water, ensuring that the vegetables are fully submerged.
5. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat.
6. Once it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer uncovered for about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Skim off any foam or impurities that rise to the surface.
7. After simmering, remove the stockpot from the heat and let it cool slightly.
8. Carefully strain the stock through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth, discarding the solids.
9. Allow the stock to cool completely before transferring it to airtight containers.
10. Store the white vegetable stock in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or freeze it for longer storage.

Now you have a flavorful white vegetable stock ready to use in your favorite vegetarian recipes. It's a great way to add depth and enhance the flavors of your dishes without using meat-based stocks.

Enjoy cooking with your homemade white vegetable stock!
