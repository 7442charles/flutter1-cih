**Method of work**
1. Place all the ingredients into a food processor and mix quickly until a wet crumb mix appears; this should take no more than 30–45 seconds.
2. Tip the mix out on to a clean surface; this is where the working of the pasta begins. Knead it lightly.
3. The pasta dough may feel wet at this stage, however the working of the gluten will take the moisture back into the dry mass, leaving a velvety-smooth finish that is malleable and easy to work; most of this process should be carried out using a pasta machine.
4. Rest the dough for 30 minutes and then it is ready to use.
5. For a classic noodle shape, roll out to a thin rectangle 45 × 15 cm. Cut into 0.5 cm strips. Leave to dry.
