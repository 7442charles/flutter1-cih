**Method of work**
1. Gently heat the olive oil in a frying pan. Add the onion, chilli and garlic and fry while stirring for one minute. Add the lardons and cook until golden.
2. Add the chopped tomatoes and tomato purée to the frying pan and simmer for 10–15 minutes, until the sauce has thickened a little. Season with salt to taste.
3. While the sauce is cooking, cook the pasta in large saucepan of boiling, salted water until al dente (fresh pasta will cook much more quickly than dried pasta). Drain the pasta and drizzle it with oil.
4. Add the basil to the sauce. Mix in the drained pasta.
