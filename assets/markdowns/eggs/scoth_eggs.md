**Method of work**
1. Place the eggs, still in their shells, in a pan of water.
2. Place over a high heat and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to simmer for approximately 9 minutes.
3. Drain and refresh the eggs under cold running water, then peel.
4. Mix the sausage meat with the thyme, parsley and spring onion in a bowl, season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
5. Divide the sausage meat mixture into four and flatten each out on a clean surface into ovals about 12 cm long and 8 cm at the widest point.
6. Roll the boiled egg in the seasoned flour.
7. Place each egg on to a sausage meat oval, then wrap the sausage meat around the egg, making sure the coating is smooth and completely covers the egg.
8. Dip each meat-coated egg in the beaten egg, covering the entire surface area.
9. Roll in the breadcrumbs to coat completely.
10. Heat the oil in a deep heavy-bottomed pan, to 180 °C.
11. Carefully place each Scotch egg into the hot oil and deep fry for 6–8 minutes, until golden and crisp and the sausage meat is completely cooked.
12. Carefully remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.


To serve, cut the egg in half and season slightly with rock salt.
