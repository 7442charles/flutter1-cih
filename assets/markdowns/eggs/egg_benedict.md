**Method of work**
1. Bring the cooking medium to a slight simmer.
2. Crack an egg into a cup and carefully slide it into the hot poaching liquid. Quickly repeat with all the eggs.
3. Poach the eggs for 3 minutes, turning them occasionally with a spoon, until the whites are firm.
4. Using a slotted spoon, remove the eggs and transfer to a kitchen towel. Lightly dab the eggs with the towel to remove any excess water.
5. While the eggs are poaching, butter the muffins and place two halves on each plate.
6. Reheat the bacon and place on top of the muffins, then top with the drained eggs.
7. To finish, lightly spoon over a generous helping of warm hollandaise sauce and serve immediately, or serve the hollandaise separately.
