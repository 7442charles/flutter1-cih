1. Break the eggs into a basin, season lightly with salt and pepper.
2. Beat well with a fork, or whisk until the yolks and whites are thoroughly combined and no streaks of white can be seen.
3. Heat the omelette pan; wipe thoroughly clean with a dry cloth.
4. Add the butter; heat until foaming but not brown.
5. Add the eggs and cook quickly, moving the mixture continuously with a fork until lightly set; remove from the heat.
6. Half fold the mixture over at right angles to the handle.
7. Tap the bottom of the pan to bring up the edge of the omelette.
8. With care, tilt the pan completely over so as to allow the omelette to fall into the centre of the dish or plate.
9. Neaten the shape if necessary and serve immediately.
