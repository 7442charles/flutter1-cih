### **Method of work**
1. Bring the water, sugar, salt and fat to the boil in a saucepan. Remove from the heat.
2. Add the sieved flour and mix in with a wooden spoon.
3. Return to a moderate heat and stir continuously until the mixture leaves the sides of the pan. (This is known as a panada.)
4. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.
5. Gradually add the beaten eggs, beating well. Do not add all the eggs at once â€“ check the consistency as you go. The mixture should just flow back when moved in one direction (it may not take all the egg).
