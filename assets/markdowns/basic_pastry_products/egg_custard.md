### **Ingredients**
- Sweet paste       250g
- Egg Yolks         9
- Custer sugar      75g
- Whipping Cream    500ml
- Nutmeg, freshly grated

### **Method of work**
1. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface, to 2 mm thickness. Use it to line a 20 cm flan ring, placed on a baking sheet.
2. Line the pastry with food-safe cling film or greaseproof paper and fill with baking beans. Bake blind in a preheated oven at 190 °C for about 10 minutes or until the pastry is turning golden brown. Remove the paper and beans, and allow to cool. Turn the oven down to 130 °C.
3. To make the custard filling, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar. Add the cream and mix well.
4. Pass the mixture through a fine sieve into a saucepan. Heat to 37 °C.
5. Fill the pastry case with the custard to 0.5 cm below the top. Place it carefully into the middle of the oven and bake for 30–40 minutes or until the custard appears to be set but not too firm.
6. Remove from the oven and cover liberally with grated nutmeg. Allow to cool to room temperature.
