|Frangipane|600g|
|Egg wash (yolk only)||

### **Method of work**
1. Divide the paste into four equal pieces. Roll out each piece in a circle with a 22 cm diameter, 4 mm thick.
2. Rest in the fridge between sheets of cling film, preferably overnight.
3. Lightly butter two baking trays and splash with water. Lay one circle of paste on to each tray and dock them.
4. Mark a 16 cm diameter circle in the centre of each.
5. Beat the pastry cream, if desired, and mix it with the frangipane.
6. Using a plain nozzle, pipe the cream over the inner circles, making them slightly domed.
7. Egg wash the outer edges of the paste. Lay one of the remaining pieces over the top of each one, smooth over and press down hard.
8. Mark the edges with a round cutter. Cut out a scallop pattern with a knife or use a cut piping nozzle as shown in the photo sequence.
9. Egg wash twice. Mark the top of both with a spiral pattern.
10. Bake at 220 °C for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with granulated sugar. Turn the oven down to 190 °C and bake for a further 20 to 25 minutes.
11. Glaze under a salamander.
