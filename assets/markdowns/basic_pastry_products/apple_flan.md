### **Method Of work**
1. Line a flan ring with sweet paste. Pierce the bottom several times with a fork.
2. Pipe a layer of pastry cream into the bottom of the flan.
3. Peel, quarter and wash the selected apple.
4. Cut into neat thin slices and lay carefully on the pastry cream, overlapping each slice. Ensure that each slice points to the centre of the flan then no difficulty should be encountered in joining up the pattern neatly.
5. Sprinkle a little sugar on the apple slices and bake the flan at 200–220 °C for 30–40 minutes.
6. When the flan is almost cooked, remove the flan ring carefully, return to the oven to complete the cooking. Mask with hot apricot glaze or flan jelly.
