|Ingredients| Quantity|
|-----------|---------|
|Flour (strong)|560g|
|Salt|12g|
|Pastry Butter or Pastry margarine|60g|
|Water, ice cold|325ml|
|pastry butter or pastry margarine|500g|
|Lemon Juice, ascorbic or tartaric acid, or white vinegar| few drops|


#### **Method of work**
1. Sieve the flour and salt together.
2. Rub in the 60 g of pastry butter/pastry margarine.
3. Make a well in the centre.
4. Add the cold water and lemon juice or acid (to make the gluten more elastic), and knead well into a smooth dough in the shape of a ball.
5. Relax the dough in a cool place for 30 minutes.
6. Cut a cross halfway through the dough and pull out the corners to form a star shape.
7. Roll out the points of the star square, leaving the centre thick.
8. Knead the remaining butter/margarine to the same texture as the dough. This is most important – if the fat is too soft it will melt and ooze out, if it is too hard it will break through the paste when being rolled.
9. Place the butter or margarine on the centre square, which is four times thicker than the flaps.
10. Fold over the flaps.
11. Roll out to 30 cm × 15 cm, cover with a cloth or plastic and rest for 5–10 minutes in a cool place.
12. Roll out to 60 cm × 20 cm, fold both the ends to the centre, and fold in half again to form a square.
**This is one double turn.**
1.  Allow to rest in a cool place for 20 minutes.
2.  Half-turn the paste to the right or the left.
3.  Give one more double turn and allow to rest for 20 minutes.
4.  Give two more double turns, allowing to rest between each.
5.  Allow to rest before using.
