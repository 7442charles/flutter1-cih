### **Method of work**
1. Prepare 200 g of sweet paste, adding the zest of one lemon to the sugar.
2. Line a 20 cm flan ring with the paste.
3. Bake blind at 190 °C for approximately 15 minutes.
4. Prepare the filling: mix the eggs and sugar together until smooth, add the cream, lemon juice and zest. Whisk well.
5. Seal the pastry, so that the filling will not leak out. Pour the filling into the flan case and bake for 30–40 minutes at 150 °C until just set. (Take care when almost cooked as overcooking will cause the filling to rise and possibly crack.)
6. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.
7. Dust with icing sugar and glaze under the grill or with a blowtorch. Portion and serve.
