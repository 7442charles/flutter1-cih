### **Method of work**
1. Prepare the fruit, wash and place in a bowl.
2. Add the sugar and water, and mix gently. (Place a clove in an apple pie.)
3. Line an appropriately sized flan ring with two thirds of the pastry, leaving a third for the top.
4. Fill the lined ring with the fruit mixture.
5. Dampen the edge of the pastry with a little water.
6. Roll out the reserved piece of pastry to cover the fruit.
7. Carefully lay the pastry on top of the fruit and firmly seal to the edge of the lined pastry. Cut off any surplus pastry.
8. Brush the top of the pie with egg wash and sprinkle with caster sugar.
9. Place the pie on a baking sheet and bake at 200 °C for 10 minutes; reduce the oven to 180 °C and continue to bake for another 25–30 minutes. If the pastry colours too quickly, cover it with a sheet of paper.
10. Once cooked, allow to cool slightly before removing the flan ring. Serve with custard, fresh cream or ice cream.
