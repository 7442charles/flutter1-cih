### **Method of work**
1. Roll out the pastry to 2 mm thick, 30 cm long.
2. Cut into 1.5 cm-wide strips. Moisten on one side.
3. Wind the strips carefully round lightly greased cream horn moulds, starting at the point and carefully overlapping each round slightly.
4. Brush with egg wash on one side and place on a greased baking sheet.
5. Bake at 220 Â°C for about 20 minutes.
6. Sprinkle with icing sugar and return to a hot oven for a few seconds to glaze.
7. Remove carefully from the moulds and allow to cool.
8. Place a little jam in the bottom of each.
9. Add the sugar and vanilla to the cream and whip until firm peaks form.
10. Place in a piping bag with a star tube and pipe a neat rose into each horn.
