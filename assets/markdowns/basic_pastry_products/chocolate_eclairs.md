### **Method of work**
1. Place the choux paste into a piping bag with a 1 cm plain tube.
2. Pipe into 8 cm lengths on to a lightly greased, dampened baking sheet.
3. Bake at 200–220 °C for about 30 minutes.
4. Allow to cool. Slit down one side, with a sharp knife.
5. Fill with Chantilly cream (or whipped cream) using a piping bag and small tube. The continental fashion is to fill with pastry cream.
6. Warm the fondant, add the finely cut chocolate, allow to melt slowly, adjusting the consistency with a little sugar and water syrup if necessary. Do not overheat or the fondant will lose its shine.
7. Glaze the éclairs by dipping them in the fondant; remove the surplus with the finger. Allow to set.

>Traditionally, chocolate éclairs were filled with chocolate pastry cream.
