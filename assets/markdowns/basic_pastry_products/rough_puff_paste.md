### **Method of work**
1. Sieve the flour and salt.
2. Cut the fat into small pieces and lightly mix them into the flour without rubbing in.
3. Make a well in the centre.
4. Add the liquid and mix to a dough. The dough should be fairly tight at this stage.
5. Turn on to a floured table and roll into an oblong strip, about 30 Ã— 10 cm, keeping the sides square.
6. Give one double turn (as for puff pastry).
7. Allow to rest in a cool place, covered with cloth or plastic for 30 minutes.
8. Give three more double turns, resting between each. (Alternatively, give six single turns.) Allow to rest before using.
