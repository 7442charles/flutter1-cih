| Unsweetened plain yoghurt        | 150ml                  |

### **Method of Work**
1. Sift the flour into a suitable bowl and add the sugar, salt and baking powder.
2. Mix the yeast into the warm milk and stir in the yoghurt. Mix thoroughly with the flour to form a dough.
3. Knead the dough until it is smooth. Cover with a clean cloth and leave to rise in a warm place for about 4 hours.
4. Divide the risen dough into 12 equal portions and, on a lightly floured surface, roll into balls.
5. Flatten the balls into oblong shapes, using both hands, and slapping the naan from one hand to the other.
6. Cook the naan bread on the sides of a tandoor oven or on a lightly greased griddle or heavy- bottomed frying pan.
7. Cook the naan on one side only. Brush the raw side with clarified butter and sprinkle with poppy seeds; turn over, cook the other side or brown under a salamander.
