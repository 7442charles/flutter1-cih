3. Knead the dough until it is smooth. Cover with a clean cloth and leave to rise in a warm place for about 4 hours.
4. Divide the risen dough into 12 equal portions and, on a lightly floured surface, roll into balls.
5. Flatten the balls into oblong shapes, using both hands, and slapping the naan from one hand to the other.
