### **Bun Wash**

Bun wash is used for most bun recipes, including Bath and chelsea buns, after baking.

### **Ingredients**
- 250ml Milk

1. Bring both ingredients to the boil and brush over liberally as soon the buns are removed from the oven. The heat from the buns will set the glaze and prevent it from soaking in, giving a characteristic sticky coat.
