### **Method of work**
1. Dissolve the yeast and sugar in half of the lukewarm water in a bowl; let sit until foamy. In
another bowl, add the remaining water, the olive oil, and the salt.
2. Pour in the yeast mixture.
3. Blend in the flour, a quarter at a time, until the dough comes together. Knead on a floured board for 10 minutes, adding flour as needed to make it smooth and elastic. Put the dough in an oiled bowl, turn to coat well, and cover with a towel.
4. Let rise in a warm draught-free place for 1 hour, until doubled in size.
5. Knock back the dough, knead it for a further 5 minutes, and gently roll it out in to a large disc or sheet to approximately 2 cm thick.
6. Let rise for 15 minutes, covered. Oil your fingers and make impressions with them in the dough, 3 cm apart. Let prove for 1 hour.
7. Preheat the oven to 210 °C. Drizzle the dough with olive oil and sprinkle with coarse salt and picked rosemary.
8. Bake for 15–20 minutes in a very hot oven at 200 °C, until golden brown. Sprinkle with additional oil if desired. Cut into squares and serve warm.
