### **Method of work**
1. Melt the butter in a saucepan.
2. Mix together 1 tbsp of honey and 4 tbsp of the water in a bowl.
3. Disperse the yeast into the honey mixture.
4. In a basin, place the melted butter, remaining honey and water, the yeast mixture and salt.
5. Add the white flour and half the wholemeal flour. Mix well.
6. Add the remaining wholemeal flour gradually, mixing well between each addition.
7. The dough should pull away from the side of the bowl and form a ball. The resulting dough should be soft and slightly sticky.
8. Turn out on to a floured work surface. Sprinkle with white flour, knead well.
9. Brush a clean bowl with melted butter or oil. Place the dough in the bowl, cover with a damp cloth and allow to prove in a warm place. This will take approximately 1–1½ hours.
10. Knock back and further knead the dough. Cover again and rest for 10–15 minutes.
11. Divide the dough into two equal pieces.
12. Form each piece of dough into a cottage loaf or place in a suitable loaf tin.
13. Allow to prove in a warm place for approximately 45 minutes.
14. Place in a preheated oven, 220 °C and bake until well browned (approximately 40–45 minutes).
15. When baked, the bread should sound hollow and the sides should feel crisp when pressed.
16. Cool on a wire rack.
