## **INGREDIENTS**

The principal ingredients in bread and dough products are wheat flour and yeast.

Bread and bread products form tha basis of our diet and are staple products in our society. 

Bread is also used as an ingredient for many other dishes.

Dough contains strong flour, water, salt ans yeast which are knead together to the required consistency.

It as then allowed to prove (to rise and increase in size), when the yeast produces carbon dioxide and water, which aerates the dough.

When baked it produces a light, digestible product with flavour and colour.

Salted dough is more manageable than unsalted dough. Salt is usually added a few moments before the end of the kneading, since its Function is to help expand the dough's volume.

## **DOUGH**
### **Fermentation**
For dough to become leavened bread (Bread that has risen rather than flat bread) it must go through a fermentation process.

This is brought about by yeast, a living micro-organism rich in protein and vitamin B. The yeast reacts with the enzymes in the dough, which converts sugar into alcohol, producing the characteristic flavour of bread.
The action also produces carbon dioxide, which makes the bread rise.

Yeast requires this ideal conditions for growth:- 
1. **Warmth**: good temperatures for dough production are 22-30°C
2. **Moisture**: he liquid should be added at approximately 37 °C – if it is cooler, the yeast may not activate; if it is any hotter it may kill the yeast
3. **Food**: this is obtained from the starch in the flour.
4. **Time**: This is needed to alloe the yeast to grow.


>Fermentation is a transformation undergone by organic matter (sugar).

## **Types of Dough**
### 1. **Enriched Doughs**

This is the basic bread dough of wheat flour, yeast and water may be enriched with fat, sugar eggs, milk and numerous other ingredients.

Examples of enriched dough are:
- **Buns** => a rich dough enriched with eggs, butter and sugar, used for a wide variety of buns including chelsea buns & swiss buns
- **Savarin** => A rich yeast dough used for savarins, babas and marignans.
- **Brioche** => A rich yeast dough with a high butter content.

### 2. **Laminated Doughs**

There are enriched doughs added fat by layering or lamination.
This makes them softer to eat because the fat in the dough insulates the water molecules, keeping the moisture level higher during baking.

Examples of laminated doughs are: 
- Croissants
- Danish Pastries

### 3. **Speciality Doughs**

- **Blinis**: A type of savaoury pancake traditionally made from buckwheat flour.
- **Naan bread**: A leavened indian bread traditionally cooked in a tandoor (oven).
- **Pitta Bread**: Middle eastern and greek unleavened bread
- **Chapatti**: an indian unleavened bread made from a fine ground wholemeal flour known as 'atta'.
- **Pizza dough**: made using a fine flour produced from the central part of the wheat grain that produces light, crisp dough. Pizza dough is often enriched with olive oil to provide moisture and flavour.


### **Working with dough**
## **Quality points**
- Check that all ingredients are weighed carefully.
- Check all temperatures carefully.
- freah yeast should be removed from the refrigerator and used at room temperature.
- Proving allows the dough to ferment.
- The second prove is essential for giving dough products the necessary volume and a good flavour.
- Time and temperature are crucial when cooking dough products. 

### **Faults in yeadt dough**

if your dough has a close texture, this may be because:
- it was insufficiently proved.
- it was insufficiently kneaded.
- contains insufficient yeast.
- the oven was too hot.
- too much water was added.
- too little water was added.

if your dough has an uneven texture:
- it was insufficiently kneaded.
- it was over-proved.
- the oven was too cool.

if your dough is wrinkled:
- too much water was added.
- too much salt was added.
- it was insufficiently kneaded.
- it was over-proved


## **Finishing and Presenting**

Depending on the type of product being made, different finished can be applied.

- scored before baking: this is used in breads such as Baguettes.
- Sprinkling with finish.
    - seeds: many breads are sprinked with poppy, sesame and fennel before baking.
    - herbs: hernbs such as red onions and sage rolls are used.
    - cheese: cheese can be used in sume recipes such as permesan rolls.
    - flour: same flour used to produce the bread can be lighly sprinked to finish.

- Egg wash: breads and laminated dough such as croissants are brushed with egg wash before baking.

## **Allergies**

The most likely allergens to be used in production of dough products are:
- **Glutten**: flour and any product made from wheat, rye, barley and oats.
- **nuts**: such as hazelnuts and nibbed almonds used in garnishing danish pastries.
- **sesame seeds**: mostly sprinked on surface of bread and rolls.
- **Eggs**: used in production of enriched doughs
- **Lactose**: found in milk, cheese and yoghurt.

> **Coeliac**: a disease that damages the lining of small intestine. 
> People intolerant to glutten should avoid wheat based products.
