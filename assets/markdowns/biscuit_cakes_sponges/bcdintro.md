## **Introduction**
The base ingredients for making cakes, biscuits and sconed are: flour, fat, sugar, raising agents, eggs and cream

# **CAKES**

There are three basic methods of making cake mixtures,
also known as cake batters. 

The working temperature of
cake batter should ideally be around 21 Â°C.

### **Preparation Methods for cake**
1. **Sugar batter method**

For this method the fat (cake margarine, butter or shortening) is bkened in a machine with caster sugar.

**stage 1**: fat and caster sugar (blend together, creaming)

**stage 2**: Colours, essences, spice or flavour (add).

**stage 3**: Beaten, liquid egg (add gradually).

**stage 4**: Sieved Flour (mix carefully).

**stage 5**: other ingredients (add according to the recipe).

2. **Flour batter method**

flour batter method, the eggs and sugar are whisked to a half sponge. This aims to foam the two ingredients together until half the maximum volume is achieved. 
Other ingredients are then added in.

**stage 1**: sieved flour (with cocoa powder, baking powder, if required)

**stage 2**: Eggs and caster sugar whisked together to half volume

**stage 3**: Equal quantities of cake margarine/ fat and flour creamed together.

**stage 4**: Fold in the remaining flour.

**stage 5**: Add other ingredients according to the recipe.



3. **Blending Method**

This method is used for high-ratio cake mixtures. 

it uses high-ration flour so thay it will absorb more liquid. it also uses a high-ration fatfor the same reason.

High ratio cakes contain more liquid and sugar resulting in a fine, stable crumb, extened shelf life, good eating and excellent freesing qualities.

**stage 1**: Flour and dry ingredients (sieve together).

**stage 2**: fat and flour (rub together to a crumbly texture).

**stage 3**: sugar, dissolved in milk (add slowly)

**stage 4**: Beaten eggs (add)


###  **Possible Reason for faults in cakes**
1. If your cake has an uneven texture
   - the fat was insufficiently rubbed in.
   - there was too little or too much liquid.

2. If your cake has a close texture
    - there was too much fat.
    - the fat to flour ratio was incorrect.

3. if your cake is dry
   - there was too little liquid.
   - the oven was too hot.

4. if the cake has cracked
   - too much baking powder.
   - too little liquid

# **SPONGES**


## **Sponge cake preparation methods**
1. **Foaming Method**: whisking eggs and sugar together.
2. **Melting Method**: as with foaming, but adding melted butter, margarine or oil to the mixture at the final stage
3. **Boiling method**: sponges made by this method have a stable crumb texture that is easier to handle and crumbles less when cut than the standard basic sponge containing fat (known as Genoise sponge).
4. **Blening method**: this is used for high-ratio sponges, which follow the same principles as high-ratio cakes.
5. **Creaming method**: The sugar and fat is creamed together, then the beaten egg is added and finally the sieved flour is added with other dry ingredients.

### **Possible reasons for faults in sponges**
1. If your sponge has lode texture:
   - It was not beaten enough.
   - too much flour
   - Oven was too hot or too cool.

2. If your sponge is sunken:
   - the oven wa too hot.
   - the tin was removed during cooking.


### **Possible reasons for faults in Genoise Sponge**
1. If the sponge has clode texture:
   - The eggs and sugar were overheated.
   - There was too much flour.
   - The oven was too hot

2. If the sponge is heavy
   - The butter was too hot.
   - The butter was insufficiently mixed in.
   - the flour was over-mixed.


### **Points to remember when baking cakes and sponges**
1. Check all ingredients carefully.
2. Weigh all ingredients carefully.
3. Make sure the eggs and fats are at room temperature.
4. Always sieve the flour o remove lumps ans any foreign material.
5. Check oven temperature.

# **BISCUITS**

### **Preparation methods**
1. Rubbing In.
2. Foaming.
3. Sugar Batter method
4. Flour batter method
5. Blending method

### **Decorating & Finishing for presentation**
1. **Filling**
Cakes, sponges and biscuits maybe filled or sandwiched together with a variety of differnt types of fillings such as : 
   - creams 
   - Fruits 
   - paste & spreads.
2. **Spreading and coating**
The tops and side of smaller cakes and gateaux are commonly covered with: 
   - fondants
   - freah whipped cream
   - royal icing
   - buttercream

3. **Pipping**
There are types of pipping tube availabled for various presentation styles. The following may be used: 
   - royal icing
   - chocolate
   - Boiled sugar
   - fresh cream 

4. **Dusting, dregging and sprinkling**
   - Dusting: a light dusting, giving an even finish
   - Dredging: heavier dusting with sugar.
   - Sprinkling: a very light sprinkle of sugar.
