### **Method of work**
1. Prepare a baking sheet by lining with silicone paper cut to fit and set the oven at 160 Â°C. Have ready a piping bag fitted with a medium plain tube. Scald two mixing bowls to ensure they are clean and free of grease.
2. Whisk the yolks, sugar and vanilla over a bain-marie until warm, then continue whisking off the heat until a thick, sabayon-like consistency is reached.
3. Sieve the flours on to paper.
4. In a second mixing bowl, whisk the whites with the sugar to a soft meringue.
5. Add the whisked yolks to the meringue and start folding in. Add the flour in 2 or 3 portions, working quickly but taking care not to overwork the mixture.
6. Using a plain piping tube, immediately pipe on to the prepared baking sheet in neat rows.
7. Dust evenly with icing sugar and immediately place in the oven for approximately 25 minutes.
8. When cooked, slide the paper (and biscuits) on to a cooling rack.
9. When cool, remove from the paper and store in an airtight container at room temperature, or leave on the paper and store in a dry cabinet.

> **Chefs Tip**
> A common problem with this recipe is over-mixing and/ or not working fast enough or being disorganised, which results in biscuits that collapse.
>
> Sponge fingers should be pale in colour, very light in texture, be dusted with icing sugar and have a rounded shape. They should also be identical in length and width.
