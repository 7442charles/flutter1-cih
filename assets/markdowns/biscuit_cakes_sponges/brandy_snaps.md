### **Method of work**

2. Pour in golden syrup until the correct weight is reached.
3. Cut the butter into small pieces. Add the butter and sugar.
4. Mix together at a slow speed.
5. Divide into 4 even pieces. Roll into sausage shapes, wrap each in cling film and chill, preferably overnight.
6. Slice each roll into rounds. Place on a baking tray, spaced well apart.
7. Flatten each round using a fork dipped in cold water, keeping a round shape.
8. Bake in a preheated oven at 200 Â°C until evenly coloured and bubbly.
9. Remove from oven. Allow to cool slightly, then lift off and shape over a dariole mould.
10. Stack the snaps, no more than 4 together, on a stainless steel tray and store.
