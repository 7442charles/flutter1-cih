|Ingredients|Quantity|
|-----------|--------|
|Plain Genoise Sponge|1*16cm|

### **Method of work**
1. Carefully split the sponge into three and line up the three pieces.
2. Place the sponge base on a cake card and moisten with rum syrup.
3. Pipe on an even layer of buttercream, no thicker than that of the sponge.
4. Place on the next layer of sponge, moisten with the syrup and repeat to give three layers of sponge and two of buttercream. Moisten the top with syrup.
5. Put in the fridge for 1–2 hours to firm up.
6. Work some coffee essence into the marzipan, roll out to 2 mm thick and lay over the gâteau, working the sides to prevent any creases.
7. Warm the fondant to blood heat, flavour with coffee essence and adjust the consistency with syrup.
8. Place the gâteau on a wire rack with a tray underneath to catch the fondant.
9. Starting in the centre and moving outwards, pour over the fondant to completely cover. Draw a palette knife across the top to remove the excess.
10. Add some melted chocolate to some of the fondant, adjust the consistency and squeeze through muslin. Decorate the gâteau by piping on a fine line design.
11. Finish the sides with squares of chocolate and the top with crystallised violets.

> **chefs tip**
> A good-quality coffee gâteau should have a moist sponge and a good balance between sponge and filling
> Fondant should never be heated above 30 °C, as the shine will be lost.
> It is best practice to use a genoise that was made the day before – fresh sponges do not cut well and are susceptible to falling apart.
