### **Method Of Work**
1. Gently cook all the sliced vegetables in the fat under a lid, without colour.
2. Mix in the flour and cook slowly for a few minutes without colour. Cool slightly.
3. Gradually mix in the hot stock. Stir and bring to the boil.
4. Add the bouquet garni and season.
5. Simmer for approximately 45 minutes; skim when necessary.
6. Remove the bouquet garni; liquidise, blend or
pass firmly through a sieve and then through a
medium strainer.
7. Return to a clean pan, reheat and correct the
seasoning and consistency.

> **Variation**
> - Instead of using the béchamel, use an additional 250ml of stock and then finish the soup with 250ml milk.
> - Alternatively, do this with an additional 375 ml of stock and finish with 125 ml of cream.
