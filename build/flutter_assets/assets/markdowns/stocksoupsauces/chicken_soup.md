### **Method of work**
1. Gently cook the sliced onions, leek and celery in
a thick-bottomed pan, in the butter or oil, without
colouring.
2. Mix in the flour; cook over a gentle heat to a
sandy texture without colouring.
3. Cool slightly; gradually mix in the hot stock. Stir to
the boil.
4. Add the bouquet garni and season.
5. Simmer for 30â€“45 minutes; skim when
necessary. Remove the bouquet garni.
6. Liquidise or pass firmly through a fine strainer.
7. Return to a clean pan, reboil and finish with milk
or cream; correct the seasoning.
8. Add the chicken garnish and serve.

> **Variation**
> Natural yoghurt, skimmed milk or non-dairy cream may be used in place of dairy cream.
> Add cooked small paste or sliced mushrooms.
