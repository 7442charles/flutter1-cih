### **Method of Work**
1. Gently cook all the sliced vegetables in the fat
under a lid, without colour.
2. Mix in the flour and cook slowly for a few minutes
without colour. Cool slightly.
3. Gradually mix in the hot stock. Stir to the boil.
4. Add the bouquet garni and season.
5. Simmer for approximately 45 minutes; skim when
necessary.
6. Remove the bouquet garni; liquidise or pass
firmly through a sieve and then through a medium
strainer.
7. Return to a clean pan, reboil, and correct the
seasoning and consistency.

> ***Variation***
> Add a little spice, sufficient to give a subtle background flavour, e.g garam masala with parsnip soup.
> just before serving add a little chopped herbs e.g parsley.
