### **Method of Work**
1. Melt the butter or heat the oil in a thick-bottomed
pan.
2. Add the bacon, onion and carrot (mirepoix) and
brown lightly.
3. Mix in the flour and cook to a sandy texture.
4. Gradually add the hot stock.
5. Stir to the boil.
6. Remove the eyes from the tomatoes, wash them
well, and squeeze them into the soup after it has
come to the boil.
7. If colour is lacking, add a little tomato purÃ©e soon
after the soup comes to the boil.
8. Add the bouquet garni and season lightly.
9. Simmer for approximately 1 hour. Skim when
required.
10. Remove the bouquet garni and mirepoix.
11. Liquidise or pass firmly through a sieve, then
through a conical strainer.
12. Return to a clean pan, correct the seasoning and
consistency. Bring to the boil.
13. Serve fried or toasted croutons separately.
