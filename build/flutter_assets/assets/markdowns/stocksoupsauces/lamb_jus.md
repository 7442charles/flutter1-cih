### **Method Of Work**
1. Preheat the oven to 175 °C. Place the herbs,
garlic and wine in a large, deep container. Place
all the bones on to a roasting rack on top of the
container of herbs and wine, and roast in the
oven for 50–60 minutes. When the bones are
completely roasted and have taken on a dark
golden-brown appearance, remove from oven.
2. Place all the ingredients in a large pot and cover
with cold water. Put the pot on to the heat and
bring to the simmer; immediately skim all fat that
rises to the surface.
3. Turn the heat off and allow the bones and
vegetables to sink. Once this has happened,
turn the heat back on and bring to just under a
simmer, making as little movement as possible to
create more of an infusion than a stock.
4. Skim continuously. Leave to infuse for 12 hours,
then pass through a fine sieve, place in the
blast chiller until cold and then in the refrigerator
overnight. Next day, reduce down rapidly, until
you have about 2 litres remaining.
