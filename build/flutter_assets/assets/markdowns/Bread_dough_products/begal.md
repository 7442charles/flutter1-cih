### **Method of work**
1. Sieve the flour, place in a mixing bowl.

3. Mix a little of the flour into the yeast to form a batter, sprinkle over some of the flour from the sides and leave to ferment.
4. Mix together the salt, sugar, oil, egg yolk and milk.
5. When the batter has fermented add the rest of the ingredients and mix to achieve a smooth dough.
6. Cover and prove for 1 hour (BFT).
7. Knock back and scale at 50 g pieces, shape into rolls and make a hole in the centre using a small rolling pin.
8. Place on a floured board and prove for 10 minutes.
9. Carefully drop into boiling water and simmer until they rise to the surface.
10. Lift out and place on a silicone-covered baking sheet, egg wash, sprinkle or dip in poppy seeds and bake at 210 Â°C for 30 minutes.
