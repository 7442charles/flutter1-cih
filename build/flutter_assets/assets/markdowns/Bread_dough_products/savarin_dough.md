### **Ingredients**
- 450g Strong Flour
- 1g Yeast
- 125ml Water
- 5 Eggs
- 60g Caster Sugar
- Salt Pinch
- 150g melted Butter

### **Method of work**
1. Sieve the flour and place in a bowl. Make a well.
2. Make a ferment by dissolving the yeast in the water and pour into the well.
3. Gradually mix the flour into the liquid, forming a thin batter. Sprinkle over a little of the flour to cover, then leave to ferment.
4. Whisk the eggs, sugar and salt.
5. When the ferment has erupted through the flour, add the eggs and mix to a smooth batter. Cover and leave to prove until double in size.
6. Add the melted butter and beat in.
7. Pipe the batter into prepared (buttered and floured) moulds one-third full.
8. Prove until the mixture reaches the top of the mould and bake at 220 °C for 12–20 minutes, depending on the size of the mould.
9. Unmould and leave to cool.

>**Chefs' Tip**
>Savarin and savarin-based products are never served without first soaking in a flavoured syrup. 
>They are literally dry sponges and should be:
>- golden brown in colour with an even surface
>- smooth, with no cracks, breaks or tears
>- evenly soaked without any hard or dry areas
>- sealed by brushing with apricot glaze after soaking.
