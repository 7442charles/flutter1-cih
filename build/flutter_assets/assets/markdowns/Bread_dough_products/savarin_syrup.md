### **Ingredients** *(3 L)*
- 2 Oranges
- 2 Lemons
- 2L Water
- 1kg Sugar
- 2 Bay Leaf
- 2 Cloves
- 2 Cinnamon sticks

### **Ingredients**
1. Peel the oranges and lemons and squeeze the juice.
2. Add all the ingredients into a large pan and bring to the boil, simmer for 2–3 minutes and pass through a conical strainer.
3. Allow to cool and measure the density (it should read 22 ° Baumé). Adjust if necessary. (More liquid will lower the density, more sugar will increase it.)
4. Reboil then dip the baked savarins into the hot syrup until they swell slightly. Check they are properly soaked before carefully removing and placing on to a wire rack with a tray underneath to drain.
5. When cooled, brush with boiling apricot glaze.

> **Chefs Tip**
> It is important that savarin syrup is at the correct density.
> If the syrup is too thin, the products are likely to disintegrate.
> If it is too dense it will not fully penetrate the product and leave a dry centre.
