### **Method Of Work**
1. Disperse the yeast in the warm water (at approximately 37 °C).
2. In a basin mix the black treacle, oil, two-thirds of the caraway seeds (if required) and the salt. Add the lager. Add the yeast and mix in the sieved rye flour. Mix well.
3. Gradually add the bread flour. Continue to add the flour until the dough is formed and it is soft and slightly sticky.
4. Turn the dough on to a lightly floured surface and knead well.
5. Knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic.
6. Place the kneaded dough into a suitable bowl that has been brushed with oil.
7. Cover with a damp cloth and allow the dough to prove in a warm place until it is double in size. This will take about 1½–2 hours. 
8. Turn the dough on to a lightly floured work surface, knock back the dough to original size. Cover and allow to rest for approximately 5–10 minutes.
9. Shape the dough into an oval approximately 25 cm long
10. Place on to a baking sheet lightly sprinkled with polenta.
11. Allow the dough to prove in a warm place, preferably in a prover, until double in size (approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour).
12. Lightly brush the loaf with egg wash, sprinkle with the remaining caraway seeds (if required).
13. Using a small, sharp knife, make three diagonal slashes, approximately 5 mm deep into the top of the loaf.
14. Place in a preheated oven at 190 °C and bake for approximately 50–55 minutes.
15. When cooked, turn out. The bread should sound hollow when tapped and the sides should feel crisp.
16. Allow to cool.
